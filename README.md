# Designing two-dimensional limit-cycle oscillators with prescribed trajectories and phase-response characteristics

__\<Description\>__ <br />
The code designs the vector field of two-dimensional limit-cycle oscillators with prescribed trajectories and phase-response characteristics.

You will get the figure like this:
<!--
<div align="center">
    <img src="figs/sl_phase.png">
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    (a) True, (b) Estimation
</div> <br />
-->

__\<Usage\>__ <br />
Please run 
- main.m for existing oscillators. 
- .m for the oscillator exhibiting multistable entrainment. 
- .m for the star-shaped oscillator. <br />
